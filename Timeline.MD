As 'Prototype 1'/main.py has become more complex to allow for any new required changes, main2.py will hereby serve as the primary file for the app using the Python Tkinter module.

Do note that C++ and C# will be used to create the app, should Tkinter does not prove to be helpful in creating the app due to its limitations. Hence, the folders "Prototype 2 (C++)" and "Prototype 3 (C#)" will be used too.

Added functionalities for scrollable output frame in main2.py.
